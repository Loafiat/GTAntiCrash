# GTAntiCrash
Makes it impossible to be crashed in Modded lobbies!
## Thank you Octo/Evelyn for helping clean the code!
### NOTE: MAY CAUSE LAG WHEN JOINING/LEAVING MODDEDS, THIS LAG IS TEMPORARY!
**If you are still getting lagged simply wait, the issue should resolve itself automatically. If not, report it to the discord along with the crash logs if you can.**

# Known issues
- When joining and leaving modded lobbies, duplicate bubbles are created. These bubbles don't effect gameplay or add lag and are (mostly) destroyed when another lobby is joined, and the total number of pooled objects (not just bubbles) shouldn't exceed 9,696 the issue will be resolved, when I get to it (so probably never because it works lol).
- Private, Modded basement lobbies don't show bubbles. ~~This is such a niche case and you don't even need the mod to play in a private modded so this won't be fixed. Just leave, disable the mod, and rejoin.~~
### Scratch that there's an easy fix for the second issue I'll fix it tommorow. ###
